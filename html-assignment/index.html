        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Sean Emmerson. I'm from Ottawa, I'm 19 years old and a student at Algonquin College. In my spare
            time, I enjoy taking pictures and
            making music. In fact, I recently graduated from the <abbr title="Music Industry Arts">MIA</abbr> program
            here at
            Algonquin with <em>Dean's Honors.</em> My end goal after this program is to secure a job in graphic or web
            design, since I'm fond of both.</p>
        <p>I hope to learn a lot from this course, and I hope to incorporate web development and elements of design
            thinking into my everyday hobbies. I'm excited to implement new things I learn into my art and to solve
            problems in the real and virtual world.
            Oh yeah, <sup>gotta add that superscript somewhere, right?</sup></p>
