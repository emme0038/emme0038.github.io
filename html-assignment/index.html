    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Sean Emmerson. I'm from Ottawa, I'm 19 years old and a student at Algonquin College. In my spare
        time, I enjoy taking pictures and
        making music. In fact, I recently graduated from the <abbr title="Music Industry Arts">MIA</abbr> program
        here at
        Algonquin with <em>Dean's Honours.</em> My end goal after this program is to secure a job in graphic or web
        design, since I'm fond of both.</p>
    <p>I hope to learn a lot from this course, and I hope to incorporate web development and elements of design
        thinking into my everyday hobbies. I'm excited to implement new things I learn into my art and to solve
        problems in the real and virtual world.
        Oh yeah, <sup>gotta add that superscript somewhere, right?</sup></p>
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>Some of my favorite hobbies include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Music Production</li>
        <li>Graphic Design</li>
