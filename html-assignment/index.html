      <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Sean Emmerson. I'm a student at Algonquin College. In my spare time, I enjoy taking pictures and making music. 
            In fact, I recently graduated from the <abbr title="Music Industry Arts">MIA</abbr> program here at Algonquin with <em>Dean's Honors.</em></p> 
        <p>I hope to learn a lot from this course, and I hope to incorporate web development and elements of design thinking into my everyday hobbies. 
              Oh yeah, <sup>gotta add that superscript somewhere, right?</sup></p>
